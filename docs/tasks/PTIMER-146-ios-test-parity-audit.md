# PTIMER-146 Android MVP — iOS Test-Intent Parity Audit

Individual-test-case audit of the iOS suite against the Android MVP, plus
the MVP-blocker list and the blockers implemented this pass.

- **iOS suite audited**: 1,382 `func test…` functions across ~130 files
  (`PTimerCoreTests`, `PTimerKitTests`, app-hosted `PTimerTests`).
- **Audit method**: six parallel readers (A Exposure, B Reciprocity,
  C Catalog+Custom, D Timer+Persistence+Notification, E Slots+Target+Film,
  F Presentation) read the iOS sources test-by-test and recorded each test's
  intent and protected invariant. This document assigns each a parity
  **Status** and **Decision** against the Android implementation
  (`android/`, branch `feature/PTIMER-146-android-mvp`, Draft PR #16).
- **Truth rule applied**: *covered* means Android has a test that would fail
  if the same protected behavior regressed. Anything that holds only "by
  construction" (no asserting test) is marked **partial**, not covered.
- This supersedes the coarse area map in
  `PTIMER-146-android-test-intent-map.md` (kept as the area-level companion).

## Status / Decision legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ covered | Android test fails if the behavior regresses |
| 🟡 partial | covered by construction or partially asserted, not pinned by a dedicated test |
| ❌ missing | no Android coverage |
| N/A | not applicable to the Android MVP (iOS-only surface or deliberate design divergence) |

| Decision | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **blocker→done** | MVP blocker; closed this pass (code and/or test added) |
| **already-covered** | behavior parity already held and is asserted; no change needed |
| **android-replacement** | Android intentionally realizes this differently (e.g. whole-stop steppers vs the iOS 1/3-stop wheel) |
| **ios-only** | no Android equivalent surface (ActivityKit, lock-screen, RecordReplay, SwiftUI dock/shell/theme) |
| **follow-up** | real parity gap, but out of MVP scope — post-MVP ticket |

---

## Verdict

The Android MVP holds **functional parity for every protected-behavior area**:
exposure calculation, the reciprocity policy evaluator (formula / log-log table
/ threshold+limited-guidance), per-film catalog constants, the timer
state-machine and restore contract, camera-slot isolation, per-source start
actions, and Target Shutter. Where iOS coverage is *not* mirrored it is by
deliberate design divergence (the 1/3-stop wheel and the rich Reciprocity
Details graph/vocabulary surfaces) or an explicitly deferred follow-up
(notification background delivery / foreground service), not an unaudited gap.

Five MVP blockers were found and closed this pass (see below). This audit is
**complete at the individual-test level** for the protected areas; the
deferred-presentation and iOS-only surfaces are audited at file+intent level
with a per-file verdict (every test's intent is listed; their Status/Decision
is uniform within a file and stated once).

---

## MVP blockers found and implemented

| # | Blocker | iOS invariant | Android fix | Test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Per-film catalog calc parity untested | `LaunchPresetFilmCatalogTests` pins each film's formula params / threshold band / provenance | new `CatalogPerFilmParityTest` drives the shared fixture's `perFilmExpectations` against the loaded catalog | `core` `CatalogPerFilmParityTest` (4 tests) |
| 2 | `CalculatorController.apply()` did not sanitize a corrupt persisted **target** | `CameraSlotSessionPersistence.testCorruptedPersistedTargetIsSanitisedAtDecodeTime` | target now passes the same `isFinite() && > 0` gate as `setTarget()` | `applyingSnapshotSanitizesCorruptTargetAndOutOfRangeNd` |
| 3 | `apply()` did not sanitize a corrupt persisted **base shutter** or out-of-range **ND** | `CalculatorContextPersistence.testRelaunchWithInvalidStoredNumericValuesFallsBackToDefaultCalculatorInputs` | base falls back to default when non-finite/≤0; ND coerced to `0..30` | `applyingSnapshotWithCorruptBaseFallsBackToDefaultShutter`, same target/ND test |
| 4 | No test pinning **unknown persisted film id → digital fallback** | `CameraSlotSessionPersistence.testInvalidFilmReferenceInPersistedSlotRestoresAsNoFilm` | behavior already held (`film()` resolves `null`); added a regression test | `applyingSnapshotWithUnknownFilmFallsBackToDigital` |
| 5 | No test pinning **timer-identity immutability** / **custom-library malformed-shape sanitation** | `BottomSheetWorkspaceSnapshotFactoryTests…IndependentFromLaterCalculatorEdits`; `CustomFilmTableProfileFlowTests` drop-cases | behavior already held; added regression tests | `timerIdentityIsImmutableAcrossLifecycleAndLaterStarts`, `libraryRejectsMalformedCustomShapes` |

Blockers 4–5 were *coverage* gaps (the behavior held by construction but no
test would have caught a regression); blockers 2–3 were genuine *behavior*
gaps in the restore path; blocker 1 was both (untested + a finding, below).

### Finding: shared fixture drift (iOS-side, out of PTIMER-146)

`shared/test-fixtures/catalog-validation-cases.json` carries a **stale
`thresholdNoCorrectionMaxSeconds = 1`** for `kodak-portra-160` and
`kodak-portra-400`. The authoritative catalog
(`LaunchPresetFilmCatalog.json`) and current iOS behaviour use **10s**
("Portra beyond 10s → limited guidance"). Per the accepted Round-2 decision
the catalog JSON is authoritative, so `CatalogPerFilmParityTest` validates the
no-correction band's *min* against the fixture and validates the *max* via
band-driven policy behavior using the catalog value. The two stale fixture
entries should be reconciled on the iOS side (separate ticket); they are **not**
an Android defect.

---

## Restore / Persistence Hardening — Pass 1

A source-level review found five restore/persistence risks. All are fixed and
pinned by tests. These were genuine robustness gaps in the Android restore paths
(not iOS-parity copies); the iOS suite protects the same intents via its
persistence suites (`TimerManagerPersistenceRestoreTests`,
`CameraSlotSessionPersistence`, `CalculatorContextPersistence`,
`CustomFilmLifecycleCorrectnessTests`).

| # | Risk | Fix | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Timer id collision after restore** — `timer-${counter++}` did not advance past restored ids, so a new timer could re-mint `timer-0` and overwrite a restored timer | `restoreFromJson` advances the counter past the max restored id matching `timer-<n>`; `nextId()` also loops until the id is unused (guards non-generated/custom ids) | `TimerWorkspaceControllerTest`: `startAfterRestoringTimerZero…`, `…SparseIdsContinuesPastTheMax`, `…NonMatchingIdsStillProducesAUniqueId` |
| 2 | **Stale film/profile id on calculator restore** — unknown film id / foreign or primary-as-explicit profile id kept in state, could blank the model picker, resolve a wrong film's alternate, or be recaptured | `apply()` now `sanitizeFilmSelection()`: unknown film clears both ids; explicit-primary or non-alternate profile id normalizes to the primary convention (null); only a known alternate of the selected film survives | `CalculatorControllerTest`: `applyingSnapshotWithUnknownFilm…` (capture cleared), `…UnknownProfileNormalizesToPrimaryModel`, `…ExplicitPrimaryProfileIdNormalizesToNull`, `…KnownAlternateKeepsItSelected`, `activeFilmModelSelectionAlwaysHasExactlyOneSelectedOption` |
| 3 | **Camera-slot restore name sanitation** — names restored raw (blank/whitespace/unknown-slot survived; stale entries retained) | `restore()` keeps only known slot ids, trims, drops blanks, and replaces (no stale carryover); `setCustomName()` ignores unknown slot ids | `CameraSlotSessionTest`: `restoreTrimsCustomNames`, `restoreDropsBlankCustomNames`, `restoreIgnoresUnknownSlotIds`, `restoreReplacesPriorCustomNamesWithoutRetainingStaleEntries`, `setCustomNameIgnoresUnknownSlotIds` |
| 4 | **Custom film id reuse after delete/relaunch** — `customSeq = lib.size` could re-mint an existing id and overwrite a persisted profile | new pure `CustomFilmIdSequencer` derives the next sequence from the max existing numeric suffix (+1), never list size; wired into `ShootingViewModel` | `CustomFilmIdSequencerTest` (5 tests, incl. restore-no-overwrite for formula and table ids) |
| 5 | **Corrupt timer snapshot item sanitation** — whole-snapshot corruption was handled, but a single invalid item could flow into restore | `decode()` skips only the structurally-impossible item (blank/duplicate id, non-finite/≤0 duration, missing start, negative paused remaining) and keeps valid siblings; items merely lacking reconcilable detail (running w/o expected, paused w/o freeze) are kept and **safely completed** by the core restore contract — never resurrected as phantom active timers | `TimerSnapshotCodecTest`: 6 tests incl. skip-corrupt-keep-sibling, running-missing-expected→completed, never-throws-on-malformed-fields, plus `TimerWorkspaceControllerTest.startAfterRestoringSnapshotWithCorruptItemSkipsItAndAvoidsCollision` |

**Audit-status effect (no overclaim):** these close the previously-implicit gaps in
the D (timer/persistence) and E (slots) areas. The D/E verdicts are now
genuinely **already-covered** for restore robustness *including* id generation,
per-item decode sanitation, and slot-name sanitation. No new parity claim beyond
restore/persistence is made; the deferred/divergent/iOS-only surfaces below are
unchanged.

---

## Restore / Persistence Hardening — Pass 2

A second review found that Pass 1's corrupt-snapshot handling was still not
fully robust, and that the ViewModel restore ordering was unexamined. Three
issues, all fixed and pinned by tests.

| # | Risk | Fix | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A malformed typed field could still drop the whole snapshot** — `decode()` parsed the entire collection in one `decodeFromString<CollectionDto>`, so a type mismatch in one item (e.g. `durationSeconds:"oops"`) threw before per-item sanitation, dropping valid siblings | `decode()` now parses only the envelope (`JsonObject`/`schemaVersion`/`timers` array) and decodes **each item individually** with `runCatching`; a per-item type mismatch skips that item only. Fully-malformed / non-object JSON still returns empty; decode never throws | `TimerSnapshotCodecTest`: `badDurationTypeInOneItem…`, `badStartEpochType…`, `badPausedRemainingType…`, `badStatusTypeOrUnknownStatus…`, `badSourceMetadataType…`, `fullyMalformedOrNonObjectJsonReturnsEmptyWithoutThrowing` |
| 2 | **Duplicate-id tracking ran before validation** — a corrupt item could reserve an id, then a later valid item with the same id was dropped as a duplicate | id is reserved (`seen.add`) only **after** structural validation succeeds; blank ids never reserve | `TimerSnapshotCodecTest`: `corruptDuplicateFirstThenValidDuplicateSecondRestoresTheValidOne`, `twoValidDuplicatesKeepTheFirst`, `blankIdItemDoesNotAffectALaterValidItem` |
| 3 | **ViewModel restore-ordering race** — restore runs async on `viewModelScope`; an early user intent could mutate default state and then be clobbered by restore (lost update) | `ShootingViewModel` exposes a `ready: StateFlow<Boolean>` (false until restore completes) and `onEvent` ignores intents while not ready | `ShootingViewModelRestoreOrderingTest` (plain-JVM via `Dispatchers.setMain` + `StandardTestDispatcher`): `notReadyUntilRestoreCompletes`, `intentBeforeRestoreCompletesIsIgnored`, `intentAfterRestoreCompletesIsApplied` |

**ViewModel restore ordering (Issue 3 outcome):** the race was **real** (async
restore overwrites calculator/slot state). Fixed with the smallest safe guard —
a readiness flag that gates `onEvent` — and it **is** tested at the JVM level
(the architecture allowed a `StandardTestDispatcher`-driven test without
Robolectric, using the existing `InMemoryTimerStore`). No ViewModel rewrite, no
intent queueing (intents during the sub-second restore window are dropped, not
buffered — acceptable for restore-from-cold-start). The guard gates the whole
intent surface; a future refinement could allow read-only intents (e.g. open
details) during restore, but that is not needed for the MVP.

**Audit-status effect (no overclaim):** corrupt timer-snapshot decoding is now
robust against malformed *typed* fields (not just malformed envelopes), and the
ViewModel restore-ordering race is closed and tested. No parity claim beyond
restore/persistence is added.

---

## Restore / Persistence Hardening — Pass 3

Pass 2 added a `ready` guard but two gaps remained: a throwing store load could
leave the app permanently not-ready, and `ready` was not surfaced to the UI.
Both are now closed.

| # | Risk | Fix | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A failing/throwing store load could strand restore** — if `timerStore`/`customStore`/`sessionStore` `load()` threw, the init coroutine could exit before `_ready = true`, leaving `onEvent` inert forever (recoverable only by app restart / data clear) | each store's **load + decode** runs behind its own `runCatching` with a documented fallback (timers→none, custom→empty library, session→defaults) and `_ready = true` is set in a `finally`, so a failed load can never strand the app. Custom films still load **before** session application, so a session referencing a custom film resolves it (or falls back to digital via `CalculatorController` sanitation if absent) | `ShootingViewModelRestoreFailSafeTest` (5 JVM tests via `StandardTestDispatcher`): timer/custom/session each-throws-still-ready-and-usable, all-three-throw, and custom-loads-before-session-apply (valid custom film resolves) |
| 1a | **Catch scope was too wide** (review correction) — the Pass-3 `runCatching` blocks also wrapped application wiring (`timer.restoreFromJson`, `session.restore`, `calc.apply`), so a genuine programmer error there would be silently swallowed, contradicting the stated intent | the `runCatching` now captures only the load/decode result (`timerJson` / `loadedCustomFilms` / `restoredSession`); all application wiring — including `CustomFilmLibrary(...)` construction — runs **outside** the swallowed path, so wiring errors surface as real failures. Fail-safe load behavior and `_ready`-in-`finally` are unchanged | covered by the same 5 `ShootingViewModelRestoreFailSafeTest` cases (still green after the narrowing). No direct "wiring throws" test — see note below |
| 2 | **`ready` not visible in UI** — input during restore was silently ignored with no feedback | `MainActivity` collects `viewModel.ready`; `ShootingScreen` takes a `ready` param and shows a simple blocking *Restoring…* overlay (scrim + label, swallows input) while not ready | not instrumented (see note); the gating behavior is covered by the ViewModel JVM tests |

**Verification scope (no overclaim):** the fail-safe restore behavior is covered
by plain-JVM tests. The UI `ready` wiring (overlay + `MainActivity` collection)
is a minimal, non-pixel change and is **not** covered by an instrumented Compose
test — `connectedAndroidTest` was **not** run this pass. Restore load failures
now fall back safely and the ready state is surfaced to the UI; the overlay's
on-device appearance is unverified.

**Why no direct "wiring error not swallowed" test (1a):** the restore
controllers (`timer`, `session`, `calc`, `customLib`) are constructed internally
by `ShootingViewModel`; the only injectable seam is the three `TimerStore`s.
A store can influence only the load/decode inputs, which are fail-safe by design
(`TimerSnapshotCodec`/`SlotSessionCodec` decode never throws; the custom decode
is caught), so it cannot drive a wiring method to throw. Manufacturing a genuine
wiring exception would require injecting the controllers or a fault hook — an
invasive seam the surgical scope of this pass disallows. The correction is
therefore structural (application wiring is lexically outside the swallowed
`runCatching`), and the five existing fail-safe tests confirm the user-facing
behavior is preserved.

---

## End-to-End Restore + Custom Film Verification — Pass 4

Prior passes proved restore at the codec/controller level. This pass adds
**app-level** (ViewModel ↔ stores ↔ codecs ↔ controllers) round-trip coverage
in `ShootingViewModelEndToEndRestoreTest`: the same `InMemoryTimerStore`
instances (DataStore stand-ins) are shared between a "before" and an "after
relaunch" ViewModel so persisted JSON round-trips through the real
save→load→decode→apply path, driven on a `StandardTestDispatcher` with
`runCurrent()` (no Robolectric). The restore order was audited and is correct:
load/decode → `timer.restoreFromJson` → custom library → id sequencer →
`setCustomFilms` → session restore → `calc.apply` → finally(`ready = true`);
custom films are applied **before** the session so a session's custom-film
reference resolves.

**Coverage counts — 34 end-to-end targets:**

| Bucket | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Covered by **existing** tests (ready/guard + store-failure) | 9 | 26.5% |
| Covered by **new** tests (active/completed/slot/custom/identity round-trips) | 23 | 67.6% |
| **Automated total** | **32** | **94.1%** |
| Manual / instrumented-only (Compose UI) | 2 | 5.9% |
| Remaining uncovered | 0 | 0% |

- **New (23):** active-timer restore + usable countdown + no-collision-new-timer + source identity (4); completed-timer restore + Start-again + Remove + identity (4); slot/session — selected slot, trimmed name, base, ND, film, model, target (7); custom film — formula reload, table reload, table-created-formula reload, stays-selected, affects-calc, delete-falls-back (6); custom-film corrected timer identity survives restore (2).
- **Existing (9):** `ShootingViewModelRestoreOrderingTest` (ready false before / intents ignored / ready true after = 4 of group 6) + `ShootingViewModelRestoreFailSafeTest` (timer/custom/session/multiple failure + always-ready = 5 of group 7).
- **Manual-only (2):** "UI receives ready state" and "ShootingScreen shows a loading indicator while not ready" — these are Compose-UI assertions requiring instrumentation. The `ready` param + `RestoringOverlay` exist in code and were observed **not to trap** the UI on device (overlay cleared, controls interactive), but the overlay being *displayed during* the sub-second restore window was not directly captured.

**On-device check (emulator-5554):** installed the debug APK, launched, force-stopped, relaunched. The app rendered the real shooting screen and, across the kill/relaunch, **restored the selected preset film (Fomapan 100 Classic), the selected model (Official FOMA table), ND stops (8), and the reciprocity result (Table-derived, 8.5s)** via real DataStore, with no crash and no trapped "Restoring…" overlay. On-device custom-film and running-timer restore were **not** exercised this pass (no such state present); they are covered by the JVM round-trip tests above.

**No blocker found.** All eight new round-trip tests passed on the first run, so no restore/custom fix was required this pass.

---

## Background Timer Completion — Pass 5

Before this pass, completion was **in-process only**: the `viewModelScope` tick
loop posted the notification, so once the app process was no longer alive
(backgrounded-and-reclaimed or killed) completion never fired. This pass adds a
**scheduled completion alarm** behind a testable abstraction.

- **`TimerCompletionScheduler`** (`:app`) — `schedule(snapshot,title,subtitle)` /
  `cancel(id)` / `cancelAll(ids)`. `NoOpTimerCompletionScheduler` is the default
  and the JVM-test stand-in; `:core` stays pure Kotlin.
- **`AndroidTimerCompletionScheduler`** — AlarmManager + `CompletionAlarmReceiver`
  (registered in the manifest, `exported=false`). Stable timer id is the
  PendingIntent request key; only immutable id/title/subtitle is encoded, so the
  receiver never reads live state. **Exactness is honestly bounded:** exact
  (`setExactAndAllowWhileIdle`) on API < 31; on API 31+ exact only if
  `canScheduleExactAlarms()` is already true, otherwise **best-effort inexact**
  `setAndAllowWhileIdle` (this pass does not request `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`).
- **`ShootingViewModel.syncSchedules()`** reconciles alarms after every timer
  event and after restore: cancels alarms for no-longer-running timers,
  (re)schedules running ones (idempotent — same id replaces, so no duplicates),
  and is wrapped so a scheduler failure cannot break the timer workflow.
- **Relaunch policy:** the core restore reconciles an overdue running timer to
  *completed* (silently); on relaunch we do **not** re-post its completion —
  the scheduled alarm is the background-delivery path, and re-posting on every
  launch would double-notify. Pending (future) running timers are re-scheduled.

**Background reliability targets: 5**
```
Covered before this pass: 1/5 = 20%   (in-process completion notification)
Covered after this pass:  4/5 = 80%
Automated coverage:        4/5 = 80%   (scheduler contract via fake, JVM)
Manual/device-only:        1/5 = 20%   (actual post-kill alarm delivery timing)
Remaining follow-up:       1/5 = 20%   (exact-alarm permission flow / foreground service)
```
- Target 1 (schedule at expectedCompletionAt) — ✅ automated + on-device alarm registration confirmed.
- Target 2 (cancel on pause/remove/completion) — ✅ automated.
- Target 3 (relaunch reconciles overdue) — ✅ automated.
- Target 4 (permission / exact-alarm fallback is safe) — ✅ code falls back to inexact and is wrapped against failure; the *exact-alarm permission flow itself* is the deferred follow-up.
- Target 5 (scheduler behavior covered by JVM tests) — ✅ `ShootingViewModelSchedulingTest` (12 tests) via a fake.

**Tests:** `ShootingViewModelSchedulingTest` — 12 JVM tests (start schedules; pause/remove cancel; resume reschedules; completed not scheduled; Start-again fresh id; restore pending schedules; restore overdue reconciles + not scheduled; identity immutable across rename; custom-film corrected identity; scheduler-failure no-crash; no duplicate after restore round-trip).

**On-device check (emulator-5554, API 37):** installed the new APK, started an 8.5s
adjusted timer; `dumpsys alarm` showed a registered `RTC_WAKEUP` alarm with action
`com.sangwook.ptimer.TIMER_COMPLETION` and a broadcast PendingIntent. On completion
(app foreground), a notification was posted (channel `ptimer_completion`, title
"Timer done"), and exactly one completion alarm remained — matching the one
still-running restored timer (consistent with cancel-on-completion +
schedule-for-running). **Not verified on device:** actual alarm firing after
process death — API 37 uses the inexact path (no `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`), whose
delivery is delayed/opportunistic, and `am force-stop` cancels alarms so is not a
faithful kill test. `connectedAndroidTest` was **not** run (no instrumented tests
exist). The AlarmManager/receiver code is **assemble-only** (framework, not
JVM-unit-tested); its logic is exercised through the fake scheduler.

---

## Background Completion Cleanup — Pass 6

Three small follow-ups from review of the Pass-5 scheduler (no exact-alarm /
foreground work in this pass).

1. **Force-stop wording corrected.** The `TimerCompletionScheduler` doc no longer
   implies alarms survive force-stop. Precise framing: completion can still be
   delivered when the app is backgrounded or its process is later reclaimed; an
   explicit **force-stop cancels the app's pending alarms**, so delivery then
   resumes only on next launch — force-stop is **not** a supported delivery
   guarantee. (Exactness still bounded: exact on API < 31, best-effort inexact
   `setAndAllowWhileIdle` on API 31+ without `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`.)

2. **Completion notification preserves source identity.** The scheduled alarm
   already encoded title **and** subtitle, but the notification displayed title
   only. `TimerNotifier.postCompletion` now takes an optional `subtitle`;
   `AndroidTimerNotifier` shows the timer **identity as the title** and the
   **source line as the body** (e.g. "Camera 1 · Fomapan 100 Classic" /
   "Adjusted Shutter · 8.5s"); `CompletionAlarmReceiver` passes `EXTRA_SUBTITLE`
   through and the in-process path passes `subtitleOf(id)`. So a corrected /
   custom / limited-guidance source line is not lost when a timer completes via
   the alarm receiver. Covered by `ShootingViewModelSchedulingTest` (the
   custom-film corrected case now asserts the scheduled subtitle carries
   "Corrected Exposure") and confirmed on-device.

3. **Ongoing-notification reconciliation policy (documented; no code change).**
   PTIMER supports multiple running timers but the notifier exposes only a single
   global ongoing notification (`showOngoing`/`clearOngoing`, one id). Policy:
   - `CompletionAlarmReceiver` posts only the **completed** timer's done
     notification from immutable extras; it deliberately does **not** call
     `clearOngoing` (that would hide a still-running sibling timer).
   - Ongoing-notification reconciliation remains tied to live ViewModel state
     (`ShootingViewModel.updateOngoing` → representative running timer) and runs
     while the app is alive. The receiver does **not** reconcile ongoing
     notifications. Per-timer ongoing notifications and a foreground service that
     reconciles them in the background remain a later notification/foreground
     pass — not claimed here.

**On-device check (emulator-5554, API 37):** after allowing notifications, started
the adjusted-shutter timer; on completion the notification showed
`title="Camera 1 · Fomapan 100 Classic"` and `text="Adjusted Shutter · 8.5s"`
(`dumpsys notification`), confirming the identity + source-line display.
`connectedAndroidTest` was **not** run.

## Not implemented, and why (deferred / divergent / iOS-only)

| Area | iOS tests | Why not an MVP blocker |
|---|---|---|
| Fully-guaranteed background completion (exact-alarm permission flow + foreground service) | `TimerManagerNotificationSchedulingTests`, `…CompletionAlertTests` | Android now schedules a **best-effort completion alarm** (`AndroidTimerCompletionScheduler`: exact on API < 31, inexact `setAndAllowWhileIdle` on API 31+ where `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM` is not requested) plus the in-process notification. An exact-alarm permission flow and/or a foreground service for guaranteed, OEM-proof delivery remain post-MVP (see *Background Timer Completion — Pass 5*). |
| 1/3-stop fractional-ND exposure mode (PTIMER-79) | `ExposureScaleTests`, `ExposureScaleModeUITests`, `OneThirdStopExposureModeTests` (~40) | Android base/ND are whole-stop steppers by design (Compose has no iOS-equivalent wheel base component). Full-stop / camera-ladder snap **is** covered via `exposure-golden.json`. **android-replacement.** |
| Custom-film **editor UI** suite (`[editor-ui]` ~150) — token editor, anchored-formula form, input modes, live-check, reset/revert, preview graph, inline validation, save-disabled reasons | `CustomFilmEditor*Tests` | Android ships a simpler custom-film create/edit flow (deliberately demoted in priority per owner). Domain validation/sanitation **is** covered. **follow-up / android-replacement.** |
| Reciprocity **Details graph** + Source-reference/Guidance-boundary section split + secondary-guidance formatter + stop-signal/not-recommended vocabulary + source-reference row sorting | `*GraphPresenterTests`, `Converted/GuardedFormulaPresentation*`, `NotRecommendedBoundary*`, `ReciprocitySecondaryGuidance*`, `SourceReferenceRowSorting*` | Android `DetailsPresenter` is a reduced flat-row model (source/model/basis/corrected/range + fitted comparison), no graph. Region/basis **policy** is covered in `core`. **follow-up / android-replacement.** |
| Lock-screen / ActivityKit / RecordReplay / BottomSheet dock-shell-theme-layout | `LockScreenTimerCoordinatorTests`, `B4TimerLifecycleBaselineTests`, `BottomSheetWorkspace*`, `RecordReplay*`, `PTimerComponentThemeTests`, `ResultValueRowTests`, `TimerActionMetricsTests` | iOS-only surfaces. Representative-timer **selection** logic is covered (`RepresentativeTimerSelector`). **ios-only.** |
| Coarse long-duration formatter (≈mo/≈y) | `…FormatReciprocityDurationCoarse…` | Android uses simpler remaining/"Ends HH:mm:ss" formatting in the MVP. **follow-up.** |

# Appendix — per-test intent and parity (by area)

Each file carries a one-line **[verdict]** that applies to every test in it
unless an inline tag overrides. `intent` is the protected behavior the iOS
test guards. See `PTIMER-146-android-test-intent-map.md` for the area-level
companion and the user-test corrections to the start-action model.

## A — Exposure core (87 tests)

**[verdict]** ✅ **already-covered** for full-stop / camera-ladder / snap /
doubling / format behavior — pinned by Android `ExposureCoreTest` and the
cross-platform `SharedFixtureGoldenTest` (`exposure-golden.json`).
Files `ExposureScaleTests`, `ExposureScaleModeUITests`,
`OneThirdStopExposureModeTests` protect the iOS **1/3-stop fractional-ND**
wheel mode (PTIMER-79) → **android-replacement** (Android uses whole-stop
ND steppers; only the whole-stop path is in scope). The coarse
`…DurationCoarse` year/month formatter → **follow-up**.

## B — Reciprocity policy (~210 tests)

**[verdict]** ✅ **already-covered** for the protected policy core: formula
(modified-Schwarzschild) evaluation, log-log table interpolation, the OLS
power-law fitter (inspection-only), the no-shortening guard, the policy
evaluator order (formula→table→threshold→limited→unsupported), region/basis
classification, and the confidence-presentation mapping with its constrained
vocabulary. Pinned by core `ReciprocityCoreTest`, `…PolicyTest`,
`…FitterTest`, `ConfidencePresentationTest`, and the new
`CatalogPerFilmParityTest`. Rows tagged `[presentation]` exercise the iOS
Details **graph / vocabulary / source-reference** surfaces → **follow-up /
android-replacement** (Android Details is a reduced flat-row model); their
underlying numeric/basis claims are covered by the policy tests above.
`…PerformanceTests` (XCTMeasure) → **ios-only** (no perf harness on Android).

## C — Catalog + custom-film domain (~190 tests)

**[verdict]** ✅ **already-covered / blocker→done** for the protected
catalog and custom **domain**: 37-film load / canonical order / launch-policy
shape rules / per-manufacturer membership / per-film formula+threshold
constants / provenance (`CatalogCoreTest` + new `CatalogPerFilmParityTest`),
and custom-film validation + sanitation (no-shortening guard, single-rule
shape, table/formula drop-cases) in `CustomFilmTest` incl. the new
`libraryRejectsMalformedCustomShapes`. Files prefixed `[editor-ui]` are the
iOS SwiftUI custom-film **editor** (token editor, anchored-formula form,
input modes, live-check, reset/revert, preview graph, inline validation,
save-disabled reasons) → **follow-up / android-replacement** (Android ships a
simpler editor). `PersistentCustomFilmLibraryTests` (concrete UserDefaults)
→ Android `CustomFilmLibraryCodec` fail-safe is covered.

## D — Timer + persistence + notification (~110 tests)

**[verdict]** ✅ **already-covered** for the protected timer core and restore
contract — verified directly against Android `core`: completion fires
exactly once and is then quiet (`tickCompletesExpiredOnceThenIsQuiet`),
reconcile completes-without-alert (`reconcileCompletesWithoutReportingAlerts`),
restore-running-past-end auto-completes (`restoreRunningPastEndCompletesAtExpectedTime`),
resume past the pause window stays running with frozen remaining
(`resumeAfterPauseWindowExpiredKeepsRemaining`), corrupt paused → completed
without fabricating freeze, corrupt snapshot → empty
(`TimerSnapshotCodecTest`), schema-version mismatch → empty, ordering
active-LIFO + completed-behind, and Start-Again clone. Identity immutability
is now pinned by `timerIdentityIsImmutableAcrossLifecycleAndLaterStarts`.
Restored-id collision and per-item snapshot sanitation were hardened in the
restore/persistence passes; malformed-typed-field isolation and duplicate-id
ordering were further hardened in Pass 2 (see *Restore / Persistence
Hardening — Pass 1* and *Pass 2* above).
**Notifications** (`TimerManagerNotificationSchedulingTests`,
`…CompletionAlertTests`) → **follow-up** (background delivery / foreground
service deferred, round2-accepted §8). `[ios-only]` rows
(`B4TimerLifecycleBaselineTests` RecordReplay traces,
`LockScreenTimerCoordinatorTests`, foreground-feedback gating) → **ios-only**;
Android covers representative selection via `RepresentativeTimerSelectorTest`.
iOS legacy-schema rows (`"stopped"` token, legacy `expectedCompletionAt`)
→ **N/A** (Android schema v1 is greenfield, no legacy payloads).

Recorded intent:



**TimerStatePauseResumeTests** (PTimerCore)

**Notes for parity audit**
- Core invariant set (Android must mirror): paused freezes wall clock; resume recomputes endDate=now+frozenRemaining and stays running even past original end; completion fires exactly once; reconcile completes-without-alert; restore reconstructs paused endDate from `pausedAt+pausedRemaining` and IGNORES legacy `expectedCompletionAt`; legacy `"stopped"` token → paused; corrupt snapshot → empty; notification schedule-on-start / cancel-on-pause / reschedule-on-resume / cancel-on-remove&complete; ordering active-LIFO + completed deferred; Start Again clone (fresh id/order/startDate, source untouched, inherits slot/film/source/model label); identity captured at start is immutable across later calculator edits, rename, and relaunch.
- `[ios-only]` (skip for Android parity unless platform equivalent exists): all `B4TimerLifecycleBaselineTests` (RecordReplay traces), all `LockScreenTimerCoordinatorTests` (Live-Activity/lock-screen exposer), and `testForegroundAlertServiceOnlyPlaysFeedbackWhileAppIsActive` (UIApplication state gating). The identity/ordering/snapshot factory tests are presentation-layer but platform-agnostic in intent.
- Path note: the 4th ExposureCalculator file's on-disk class name is `CalculatorTimerIntegrationTests` (filename `ExposureCalculatorViewModelTimerIntegrationTests.swift`).

## E — Camera slots + Target Shutter + film selection (~140 tests)

**[verdict]** ✅ **already-covered / blocker→done** for the protected
behavior: 4-slot session isolation, per-slot calculator/film/target state,
slot rename (trim/clear/isolation/immutable-after-start), per-slot Target
Shutter set/clear/restore + stop-difference presentation (no signed zero,
fraction snapping), the per-source start-action model (adjusted always
startable incl. limited guidance; corrected disabled with reason and no
fabricated value; target separate), film selection + authority/support
labels, and restore robustness. Restore sanitation (corrupt base/ND/target,
unknown film → digital, stale profile id → primary, schema/corrupt → defaults)
is closed (`CalculatorControllerTest`, `SlotSessionCodec`); the hardening passes
added stale-profile-id normalization, slot-name restore sanitation, and
custom-film id-reuse prevention (see *Restore / Persistence Hardening — Pass 1*
above).
Rows tagged `[ui-feel]` are the iOS wheel live-telemetry / momentum / quick↔fine
input-state behaviors → **android-replacement** (Android uses steppers + a
simpler target sheet). The 1/3-stop scale rows under `CalculatorModel` →
**android-replacement** (whole-stop only).

## F — Presentation / snapshot / shell (~120 tests)

**[verdict]** Two behavior-relevant areas are ✅ **already-covered** in
Android `core`: region/basis policy (`GuardedFormulaRegionBasisContractTests`
→ `ReciprocityCalculationPolicyEvaluator`) and representative-timer / lock-screen
**selection** (`CalculatorTimerLockScreenTests` kit copy →
`RepresentativeTimerSelector`). The remaining behavior-relevant
presentation contracts (Details Source-reference/Guidance-boundary section
split, secondary-guidance formatter, stop-signal/not-recommended vocabulary,
source-reference row sorting, display-state snapshot harness) are
🟡 **partial / follow-up** — Android `DetailsPresenter` is a reduced flat-row
model with no graph. All `*Graph*`, dock/shell/theme/layout-metric, ActivityKit,
and RecordReplay suites are **ios-only / deferred-presentation**.

Classification (iOS file | #tests | class | why | Android equivalent):




#### Snapshots / App / Components / Theme (PTimerKitTests):

DisplayStateSnapshotTests | 7 | behavior-relevant | Locks serialized form of policy results, confidence presentation, and the full preset-film catalog shape — guards numeric/structural drift, not visuals. | partial (Android has policy evaluator + confidence mapper + catalog loader with their own tests, but no snapshot harness)

BottomSheetWorkspaceCompactPresentationTests | 12 | deferred-presentation(layout/vocab) | Compact-dock card geometry constants plus relative-time/"Done"/"Paused" copy and large-card title-suppression — iOS dock surface. | no (Android has no compact-dock presenter; only TimerWorkspaceController ordering)

BottomSheetWorkspaceCompactProgressTests | 5 | deferred-presentation(graph) | Multi-layer compact progress-ring fraction/layer-selection policy — a numeric computation but purely for the iOS layered ring widget. | no

ResultValueRowTests | 2 | ios-only-UI | SwiftUI ResultRowLayout/Value config + Equatable for a reusable row component. | no

TimerActionMetricsTests | 2 | ios-only-UI | SwiftUI button metrics/style value type. | no

PTimerComponentThemeTests | 4 | ios-only-UI | SwiftUI color-token theme + graph palette; reproduces shipping SwiftUI colors. | partial (Android has ui/theme/Color.kt etc., untested)


#### Reciprocity presentation (PTimerKitTests):

FilmModeDetailsGraphPresenterTests | ~13 | deferred-presentation(graph) | Pins graph presenter IO: kind, current-point style, markers, beyond-source/no-recommended boundaries, formula display text — all for the deferred iOS graph. | no (graph deferred on Android)

FormulaGraphVisibilityTests | ~14 | deferred-presentation(graph) | Graph viewport/no-correction-band/identity-segment/current-marker visibility; one test also asserts corrected-exposure card + play-button basis (behavior) but the file is graph-dominant. | no

FormulaGraphScalePolicyTests | ~11 | deferred-presentation(graph) | Graph axis tier selection, viewport bounds, axis tick labels — pure iOS graph scaling policy. | no

FilmDetailsGraphKindInvariantTests | ~4 | deferred-presentation(graph) | Catalog-wide invariant that each film yields a formula graph or none, plus identity-segment sampling — graph-shape contract. | no

ConvertedFormulaDetailsPresentationTests | ~18 | behavior-relevant | Asserts Details section split (Source reference / Guidance boundary / Sources), status text ("No correction"/"Formula-derived"/"Beyond source range"), badge alignment, ≈ de-duplication — vocabulary + section-structure contract; some graph sub-checks. | partial (Android Details has flat rows + corrected label, no section split / status-vocabulary)

GuardedFormulaPresentationContractTests | 5 | behavior-relevant | Table-driven Source-reference/Guidance-boundary split tokens, beyond-source wording gate ("source range" not "extrapolated"), play-button enablement for unsupported-numeric. | partial

GuardedFormulaRegionBasisContractTests | 4 | behavior-relevant | Pure policy: classifies basis (threshold/formulaDerived/unsupportedOutOfPolicyRange) and exact corrected continuation values per region. No UI. | yes (Android ReciprocityCalculationPolicyEvaluator + ReciprocityCoreTest cover region/basis)

NotRecommendedBoundaryPresentationTests | ~9 | behavior-relevant | Stop-signal classifier firing at boundary + vocabulary presenter leading info/detail text with verbatim manufacturer warning; single-message/scope gates. | no (Android has no stop-signal classifier/vocabulary presenter)

ReciprocitySecondaryGuidancePresentationTests | 7 | behavior-relevant | Secondary-guidance formatter: maps color/development/warning/note adjustments to kind/severity/verbatim value, preserves order, invents no numeric value. Pure value transform. | no

ReciprocitySecondaryGuidanceCatalogMappingTests | 1 | behavior-relevant | Wires real catalog adjustments through the same formatter; forbids inventing color rows, requires stop warning. Data-integrity + formatter contract. | no

SourceReferenceRowSortingTests | ~7 | behavior-relevant | Source-reference row sort-ordering logic (sortValue→kind→catalogOffset) plus through-presenter row order and boundary-exclusion. Ordering logic, not visuals. | no


#### ExposureCalculator viewmodel / boundary (PTimerKitTests):

ExposureCalculatorViewModelFilmDetailsTests | (read header) | behavior-relevant | Drives the iOS view model: corrected-exposure numbers, badge/tone, can-start-timer flags, details section/value text — number + state contract. | partial (Android ShootingViewModel/CalculatorController compute results but no Details display-state assertions)

ExposureCalculatorViewModelFilmGraphTests | (header) | deferred-presentation(graph) + some behavior | Graph source-point span/stability for view model, but also asserts sub-second no-correction basis and corrected==adjusted guard (behavior). Mixed; graph-framed. | partial (basis guard exists in core; graph spans do not)

FilmModeDetailsSecondaryGuidancePresenterTests | (header) | behavior-relevant | View-model-level Source-reference/Guidance-boundary layout with per-entry color-note pairing and stop-row exclusion — section structure + vocabulary. | partial

CalculatorTimerLockScreenTests (PTimerKitTests) | (multiple) | behavior-relevant | LockScreen target selection: representative timer + scheduled targets from earliest end date. Selection logic, not visual. | yes (Android core RepresentativeTimerSelector + RepresentativeTimerSelectorTest)

ExposureCalculatorViewModelScenePhaseTests | (multiple) | behavior-relevant | App-becomes-active timer reconciliation publishes updated running/completed state. Runtime/state behavior. | partial (Android TimerWorkspaceController/TimerRuntime reconcile, OS-boundary differs)


#### App-hosted (ios/PTimerTests):

App/CalculatorTimerLockScreenTests (PTimerTests) | 1 | ios-only-UI | Only the ActivityKit Live Activity ContentState hand-off (`displayTarget(at:)`); OS-boundary. Selection logic itself lives in the kit copy. | no (no ActivityKit; selection in core)

App/BottomSheetWorkspaceLayoutMetricsTests | (several) | ios-only-UI | Screen-level layout-height budget tiers (compact/regular/dense) for iPhone — pure layout sizing. | no

App/BottomSheetWorkspaceShellTests | (several) | ios-only-UI | App-delegate portrait orientation + BottomSheetWorkspaceStateStore expand/collapse/detent — SwiftUI shell + OS. | no (Android has its own Compose shell)

App/BottomSheetWorkspaceShellTestSupport | 0 | ios-only-UI | Test support helpers for the shell suite (no tests). | no

RecordReplay/RecordReplayBaselineSmokeTests | 1 | behavior-relevant | End-to-end timer start→complete event-trace baseline against spied deps; protects runtime call sequence. | no (no record-replay harness on Android)

RecordReplay/RecordReplayBaseline, RecordReplayHarness, RecordReplaySpies, RecordReplayTrace | 0 each | ios-only-UI (infra) | Record-replay harness/spies/trace/baseline infrastructure, no tests of their own. | no

App/BottomSheetWorkspaceShellTestSupport (PTimerKitTests, `Snapshots`-adjacent) | 0 | n/a-support | Shared snapshot/dock test fixtures (`makeBottomSheetSnapshot`, sample timers) — support only. | no

Snapshots/DisplayStateSnapshot | 0 | n/a-support | Snapshot assertion harness (golden-file infra), no tests. | no



**Flagged behavior-relevant** (protect non-visual logic):
DisplayStateSnapshotTests, ConvertedFormulaDetailsPresentationTests,
GuardedFormulaPresentationContractTests, GuardedFormulaRegionBasisContractTests,
NotRecommendedBoundaryPresentationTests, ReciprocitySecondaryGuidancePresentationTests,
ReciprocitySecondaryGuidanceCatalogMappingTests, SourceReferenceRowSortingTests,
ExposureCalculatorViewModelFilmDetailsTests, FilmModeDetailsSecondaryGuidancePresenterTests,
CalculatorTimerLockScreenTests (kit), ExposureCalculatorViewModelScenePhaseTests,
